# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

## Learning Objectives

### General

## Why Python programming is awesome

Python programming is considered awesome due to its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It’s a high-level language that emphasizes code readability, allowing developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to languages like C++ or Java.

## Who created Python
Guido van Rossum

## Who is Guido van Rossum

a Dutch programmer, created Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language6. He is known as Python’s principal author and was titled the “Benevolent Dictator for Life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from this position in July 20187.

## Where does the name ‘Python’ come from

The name ‘Python’ was inspired by the British comedy series “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”. Guido van Rossum was reading the published scripts from the show while developing the language and wanted a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious.

## What is the Zen of Python

The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 guiding principles for writing computer programs in the Python language. These aphorisms emphasize simplicity and readability, and they were written by Tim Peters

## How to use the Python interpreter
To use the Python interpreter, you typically start it by typing python or python3 in your command line interface. You can execute Python code interactively or run a Python script file.

## How to print text and variables using print

## Printing text and variables using the print function in Python can be done in various ways, including *concatenation*, *formatting*, and using *f-strings*. For example:
```python
name = "World"
print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

## How to use strings

### Strings in Python are sequences of characters surrounded by single or double quotes. They can be indexed, sliced, and manipulated using various methods provided by Python

## What are indexing and slicing in Python

### Indexing and slicing are used to access parts of sequences like strings, lists, or tuples. Indexing retrieves a single item, while slicing retrieves a range of items.


## What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle

### The official Python coding style is defined in PEP 8, which covers naming conventions, indentation, line length, and more. To check your code against these standards, you can use the pycodestyle tool. You can install it using pip and then run it on your Python files to check for style issues30313233.

All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Shell Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
All your files must be executable
C Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
