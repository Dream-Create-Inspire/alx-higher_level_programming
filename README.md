#Higher Level Programming

*Higher level programming refers to the class of programming languages that provide strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming languages, which are closely related to the machine's hardware architecture, higher level languages are more human-readable and easier to write, debug, and maintain.*

*These languages often manage memory allocation, provide extensive libraries and APIs, and offer features like garbage collection that help prevent memory leaks and other bugs. Examples of higher level programming languages include Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript.*

*The main advantage of higher level programming is that it allows developers to focus more on solving problems and implementing algorithms rather than dealing with the complexities of the hardware.*
